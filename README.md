# Multiplication-App
Here are step-by-step instructions to create a simple multiplication app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:

Step 1: Set up your project structure
Create a new folder for your project. Inside this folder, create three files: index.html, styles.css, and script.js.

Step 2: Write HTML markup
In the index.html file, write the HTML structure for your app. Include input fields for two numbers, a button to trigger the multiplication operation, and a place to display the result.

Step 3: Style your app with CSS
In the styles.css file, add styles to make your app visually appealing.

Step 4: Write JavaScript logic
In the script.js file, write JavaScript code to handle the multiplication operation.

Step 5: Test your app
Open the index.html file in a web browser. Enter two numbers, click the "Multiply" button, and observe the result.
